            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following <hi>Remonstrance</hi> comes not from a common mercenary Pen, or from any private Person inflam'd by the present Conduct of <hi>France,</hi> it abounds with too many Intrigues, and Secrets of the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> and is inrich'd with too Authentick <hi>Memoirs,</hi> to be the Work of any other Writer, then a great <hi>Minister</hi> of State imploy'd in the Confederate Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and for the Publick Good of <hi>Christendom.</hi> He lays o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the vicious Methods of the <hi>French</hi> Councels, fatally corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Machivellian Maxime,</hi> Of <hi>sticking at nothing to gain a Point;</hi> which having crawl'd on this side of the <hi>Alps,</hi> like a venemous sort of <hi>Vermine,</hi> infests the <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Closets</hi> of Great Men; hence springs all the modern <hi>Treachery</hi> and <hi>Barbarity,</hi> which sets the World on fire, and turns the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Frame of things into a <hi>Chaos. Aristotle's Morals, Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's Offices,</hi> and the <hi>Bible,</hi> the good Old Guides of our <hi>Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> serve now only to render a Man <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> a <hi>Cully,</hi> and a <hi>Beggar.</hi> A better Lesson may be taught these new <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> out of an <hi>Italian</hi> Master of as elevated a Genius, and of as subtile Thought, as their clear <hi>Florentine</hi> Wit <hi>Nicolo Machivelli,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96208:3"/>I mean <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> who gives the following Instructions to the wisest Body of Men that ever compos'd a Government, since the Glorious Ages of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> His Words follow:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all Occurrences where the Publick Faith is engag'd, let it be inviolably kept, without minding any present ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that might accrue by the breaking of it, for that is but momentaneous: Whereas the benefit of keeping Faith is Eternal; and a Prince that breaks his Word, must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a New Religion to make himself be believ'd another time, seeing the Oaths he made in the Religion he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, have not been able to bind him.</hi> The Opinion of <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> given to the Lords the Inquisitors of State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. <hi>24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This pestilential <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Dissimulation,</hi> and using all manner of immoral means to compass the <hi>End,</hi> is the great <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum</hi> of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and the chief <hi>Spell</hi> of all their <hi>Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> whereby they take greater advantages over that part of Mankind which steers a Course of <hi>Vertue,</hi> then the <hi>Rooks</hi> and <hi>Sharpers</hi> here about the Town do over the fair <hi>Gamesters,</hi> with their false Dice, and Cards, and Flattery. 'Tis this pernicious Doctrine that so long wheedled and decoy'd the credulous and good-natur'd People of <hi>England;</hi> but at last broke all the late <hi>Juglers</hi> at <hi>White-Hall:</hi> yet it still moves on the Springs and Wheels at <hi>Versailles</hi> with such a rapidity and heat, that the World never saw such a Combustion, since <hi>Phaeton</hi> put it all into Flames, and <hi>Heaven</hi> knows when we shall see it quench'd.</p>

            <head>NEW DECLARATION OF THE Confederate Princes and States, AGAINST Lewis the XIV.</head>
            <p>ALL Laws Divine and Human, which have given Authority to Magistrates over the People, have always meant, that <hi>Justice</hi> was the foundation of Government, which must be distinguish'd from Tyranny; and whereas it cannot subsist or operate without <hi>Truth,</hi> therefore it is necessary that she should make one of the Embassy, and go freely to the Thrones of the greatest Monarchs, swell'd either with Ambition, painted with Flattery, or blinded with Interest. <hi>Justice</hi> demands <hi>Truth</hi> to be always admitted to plead her Cause against Calumny, Envy, Treachery, and the rest of the Vices, which are always making War upon her in the Courts of Princes, especially in That of Your Majesty, under the Protection of a violent unmerciful <hi>Minister,</hi> as much an Enemy to Innocence, as a Friend to Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Tis therefore by the Order of this <hi>Justice,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Kingdoms are but Wildernesses and Shambles, that <hi>Truth</hi> presents her self to the Audience of Your Most Christian Majesty, to demand, in the Name of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96208:4"/>the reasons of your Perjuries, Violations of solemn Treaties, without the least pretence; of your many Massacres committed by surprize, your profaning the most Sacred Things; and, after Capitulations, pillaging, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cities, Churches, Monasteries, Colleges, Palaces, and laying waste whole Countreys; your Soldiers ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down, without distinction of Age or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Europe (Sir)</hi> asks you the reason why so many Orphans are made, and so many Infants crush'd under the Ruins, or devour'd by the Flames? <hi>She</hi> demands the reasons of many more of your execrable Barbarities, which cannot be express'd, the very thoughts whereof would fill with horrour the most Savage Nations, and the sworn Enemies of God Almighty; the Rivers of Tears, the Sighs and Groans of Millions of Christians, cry to Heaven for Vengeance, which the Just God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves for you.</p>
            <p>Your Birth <hi>(Sir)</hi> after which your People groan'd many years, has acquir'd you the Name of <hi>The Son of God:</hi> Your regulations of the Finances, your seizing all the Properties of your Subjects, has given you the Title of <hi>Just.</hi> The Usurpations and Extensions of your Limits, between the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Moselle,</hi> and the <hi>Maes,</hi> in time of Peace, by all sorts of pretences of <hi>Dependances, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, Re-unions,</hi> decreed in your own <hi>Chambers,</hi> have given occasion to weak Pens to style you <hi>Invincible,</hi> without ever drawing your Sword. Flattery has erected you a Statue at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the place call'd <hi>Victoires,</hi> and by the Inscription (which never any Christian Monarch was yet so vain to assume,) proclaims you <hi>Hemo Immortalis.</hi> The same Court-<hi>Parasite</hi> has adorn'd it with Lamps and Incense, appropriated to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> zealous of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and who will not suffer any Rival: History affords many Examples of this; <hi>Josephus</hi> in his 17th Book of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96208:4"/>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Herod array'd in royal apparel, sate upon his Throne, and made an Oration unto them; the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a God, and not of a Man; and immediately the Angel of the Lord smote Herod, because he gave not God the Glory, and he was eaten of Worms, and gave up the Ghost;</hi> turning about to his Flatterers, and saying, <hi>mn quem Deum immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem salutastis, jam mortalis vitam relinquere jubeor, &amp; fatali necessitate vestrum arguere mendacium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! Your Most Christian Majesty carries too many Proofs about you, that your Body is not immortal; flaming <hi>Comets</hi> begin first to burn and waste away at the <hi>Tail;</hi> all your Lustre and Blaze serves only to discover and lay open the bloody Scenes of your Life. <hi>Christendom</hi> was once in hopes, that Your Majesty would have studied and imitated the commendable Actions of some of your most Glorious Ancestors, especially those of St. <hi>Louis,</hi> who hating nothing more than the coveting his Neighbour's Goods, contented himself with that Kingdom which God Almighty and his People had entrusted him with: He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd much of his time in pacifying and healing the dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferences of his Neighbours, without raising new ones at the same time, or taking any advantage at their Quarrels: He sacrific'd his Royal Person, to chastise the Infidels, and to defend <hi>Christendom;</hi> whereas Your Majesty has conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Turks</hi> to the very Walls of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and laid ready at the same time upon the Frontiers, to fall in for the prey of the whole Empire.</p>
            <p>One of Your Majesty's Predecessors, King <hi>Clovis,</hi> who had done such great Actions, that they pass'd for Miracles, at last blasted all his Glory, by breaking his Faith and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with <hi>Alarick</hi> King of the <hi>Vice-Goths:</hi> He complain'd of the Limits, and of the diversity of Religion (a Pretext which Your Majesty's Ministers often make use of to move
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96208:5"/>the Springs and Wheels of their wicked Machines); yet the French Historians brand him with the Epithets of <hi>Ambitions, Envious, Cholerick, Revengeful,</hi> and <hi>Bloody. Clotaire,</hi> another of your Predecessors, had no other God (says the Historian <hi>Etienne Pasquier</hi>) but his own Will and Passion. <hi>Dagobert,</hi> who is famous in the Chronicles of <hi>France</hi> for founding Churches and Monasteries, sully'd all his Merit by robbing <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul:</hi> He took away the fine Gates of the Church of St. <hi>Hilary</hi> at <hi>Poitiers,</hi> and plac'd them before that which he was building at St. <hi>Denis.</hi> Your Majesty has done the same, in forcing away in time of Peace the Knights of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, and those of <hi>Malta,</hi> from their Estates and Commands in the Empire, and in driving away from your Court in a most ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious manner the <hi>Envoys</hi> of the <hi>Grand Masters,</hi> contrary to the Faith and Honour of publick Treaties made with them, who came only to demand their Right of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Just:</hi> Your Majesty has depriv'd them of their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, whilst the brave Knights are fighting in <hi>Hungary</hi> and the <hi>Morea</hi> for the Honour of <hi>Christendom;</hi> and you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to employ their Patrimony for the raising and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the Foundations of your devoted Knights of St. <hi>Lazarus. Lothaire</hi> is represented by the <hi>French</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians as the most corrupt and worst Prince that ever reigned, because he had ravaged the Church, ransack'd the Ecclesiasticks, broke his Oaths, as often as he saw an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>I have too much Respect for Your Most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, to apply the Histories of Kings dead so many Ages ago, to the present Calamities of your Reign, tho' it is the Character and Essence of <hi>Truth</hi> to conceal nothing. I could <hi>(Sir)</hi> present you with a long Series of other Kings, infamous for the very Vertues of your time; but I had rather be silent, than weary your attention, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96208:5"/>I desire Your Majesty to apply seriousty to what I shall now say with my wonted simplicity and nakedness, without the least <hi>Hyperbole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Flattery hath often compar'd Your Majesty, for these last twenty years, to the <hi>Sun,</hi> as to the Star of Stars, from whom all other Kings borrow their Lustre, and depend as upon the King of kings. The Duke de <hi>Feuillade</hi> hath erected your Effigies (I suppose by Your Majesty's own secret Order), encompassed with Rays; but he forgot to tell you, That the Father of Light often suffers Eclipses, and is cover'd with Spots, as Your Majesty's Splendor is at present, though your own Mercenary Writers proclaim to all the World, That the most Glorious Actions of Princes past and to come are no more to be compar'd to the least of Yours, than the Planets, the Comets, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, are to the Sun; which piece of Vanity verifies the old Character given of the <hi>French, That they act rather by a principle of Transport and Impetuosity, than of Reason and Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Virtuous Action would immortalize Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty better than a thousand Inscriptions, Panegyricks, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, Triumphal Arches, Colossus's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas the Universal Afflictions which <hi>Christendom</hi> suffers by Your Majesty's Orders, are so far from rendring you <hi>Homo immortalis,</hi> that they begin to revive the ancient Custom and Opinion of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in your <hi>French</hi> Subjects, who were of such a Sanguinary Complexion, as to believe, That they could never better appease their Gods, or make them propitious, than by shedding human Blood, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing Men, Women, and Children; which the Heathens (their Enemies) stood amaz'd at.</p>

Consider, <hi>Sir,</hi> from whom you have ravished the City and County of <hi>Avignon,</hi> 'tis from the <hi>Church,</hi> (your <hi>Mother</hi>) not from the <hi>Pope;</hi> therefore the Quarrel with him cannot justify your Conduct in this Robbery. The <hi>Heresie</hi> of the City and Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> was your Pretext to invade and usurp them; that Argument ceases in the Case of <hi>Avignon;</hi> Where is the glory in stealing of Countries unarm'd, unforti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd, defended by Priests, and poor naked Peasants?

No body is ignorant of your Intrigues and Briberies in the Court and Diet of <hi>Poland,</hi> in order to throw all into confusion, and to put the <hi>Poles</hi> out of all condition to carry on any successful War against the <hi>Turk;</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Bethune</hi> is known to be the Spy and Agent of that <hi>Roguery.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I could easily convince Your Majesty, that Your Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation with the <hi>Ottoman Port,</hi> to destroy the Empire, might have been fatal to Your self. For amongst the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners taken at the Battel of <hi>Barkan,</hi> after the raising the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Silistria</hi> was one, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd to the great <hi>General</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> That the Grand <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi> was resolv'd, upon the taking of <hi>Vienna,</hi> to fly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into the Bowels of the Empire, and to march in person to <hi>Ratisbon;</hi> for which Expedition he had made provision of Money, Ammunition, and all other Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for Eighteen Months. Now what could Your Majesty have done upon such a vast Inundation of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> spreading towards the Borders of <hi>France;</hi> it would have been too late to have dealt with the <hi>Turks,</hi> as Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Father did with the <hi>Swedes;</hi> who growing very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable in the Empire by <hi>French Intrigues,</hi> and advancing too near the <hi>Rhine,</hi> gave <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIIIth great jealousie and fear of their Progress and Success; whereupon, to prevent the ill consequences, Your <hi>Father</hi> suspended the payment of the Subsidies, and other Assistances, which he had all along afforded them under-hand, and neglected no manner of means to disperse the remains of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces, that surviv'd the loss of their immortal <hi>Hero,</hi> the Great <hi>Gustavas Adolphus,</hi> and were headed by the <hi>Duke of Saxe Weimar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not the first time, that the mad <hi>Caprices</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> have arm'd many Nations against them. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Valentinian</hi> writ to <hi>Theodorick,</hi> That there was an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensable necessity to unite themselves against the <hi>French,</hi> who were so transported with the vain notion of Glory, that they began to affect in that Age a Universal Empire, as tho
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96208:8"/>every thing belong'd to them: That they never began any War, for which they could assign any cause, or the least reason; for they call'd every thing just, which-was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Exorbitant Lusts and Passions; <hi>Vide Anton.

            <p>Can Your Majesty be so blind, or vain, as to imagine that the Confederate Princes and States will bear any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with the <hi>Chimera</hi>'s and <hi>Phrensies</hi> of the Brains of Your <hi>Ministers,</hi> published in so many Scandalous <hi>Manifesto's,</hi> which ought to be purg'd with large Doses of <hi>Hellebore.</hi> How can Your Majesty treat the <hi>Emperor</hi> as a Calumniator, because he will not suffer himself to be amus'd any longer with the publick Professions of Your Sincerity to preserve the Peace and Repose of Christendom? We cannot but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule Your Majesty for prostituting Your Glory to the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines,</hi> and humbling Your self at the Feet of such a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, in offering them Your Ports to facilitate their Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations upon the <hi>Christians;</hi> by which You have rendred them so stiff, that they demand full Reparations for the Damages done by Your Bombs, and the restitution of all Slaves.</p>
            <p>How can You, Sir, tax the <hi>Emperor</hi> with disturbing the publick Peace, after He had born so long with Your Insults, and Usurpations?

            <p>The Sons and Brothers of the present <hi>Prince Palatine</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appear'd at <hi>Cologn</hi> in favour of the Election of the young Prince of <hi>Bavaria</hi> against Cardinal <hi>Fustenberg,</hi> an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Empire, seizing upon the whole <hi>Electorate</hi> with swarms of <hi>French</hi> Troops before he had ever one Vote gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Chapter; or indeed, before the breath was out of the late <hi>Elector</hi>'s Mouth, gave umbrage to Your Majesty to burn and destroy all the Countries and Estates belonging to the good old <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> their Father, as his Dutchy of <hi>Juliers,</hi> the County of <hi>Bergue,</hi> the ancient Palace and Castle of <hi>Heydelberg;</hi> all his Cities in the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate,</hi> as <hi>Manheim, Nieustad, Frankendale,</hi> &amp;c. carrying away all the Goods and Chattels of the Countrey, whereby all manner of subsistence might be taken away from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Inhabitants, whose Ghosts cry out for Vengeance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Treves</hi> hath been treated by Your Majesty more like a Rebel, than a Sovereign Prince, because he thought it his duty to be faithful to the Interest of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the Church, of which he is an Illustrious Member: Your Majesty first seis'd, then dismantled, now plunder'd and burnt the Capital City of <hi>Treves,</hi> and turn'd his whole <hi>Electorate</hi> into a Wilderness of Ruines, and Ashes. The <hi>Marquis de Bousters</hi> has been the Executioner of all Your
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96208:9"/>Cruelties in that Countrey, having last Winter turn'd the beautiful City of <hi>Coblentz</hi> into a Furnace, with his Bombs and Carcasses, there now remaining little of the Place, only heaps of Stones, and Cinders; 'twas wonderful to see with what patience and constancy the <hi>Elector of Treves</hi> view'd from his Castle of <hi>Hermanstein</hi> his City of <hi>Coblentz</hi> burning and tumbling under his eyes, and afterwards his whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in flames, not so much as one Church standing for the worship of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> tho there were reckon'd above 800 Religious Houses in the <hi>Electorate,</hi> six Cities, forty great Towns, 400 Villages, and sixty great Castles.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Elector of Mentz</hi> being weary of Your Majesty's Yoke, began to espouse the Cause of the Empire and the Church, having suffer'd long under the Chains You had put upon him: <hi>Monsieur Fouchay,</hi> and Your Officers affronted him daily with intolerable Indignities, contrary to the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and Your Majesty's Royal Word, which at last prov'd of fatal consequence to his Subjects and Country; his Palace was soon ransack't, the Monasteries and Citizens Houses plunder'd, and all utterly ruin'd, tho under the stipulated and solemn protection of Your Majesty, who assumes the Titles of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Just,</hi> the <hi>Pious,</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What has the Circle of <hi>Suabia</hi> done to Your Majesty, to be so barbarously dealt with, contrary to all the Rules of Christianity, and the common Maxims of War? She commits no Hostilities against Your Majesty, sends no Forces to join the Confederates upon the <hi>Rhine;</hi> all her Troops are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in <hi>Hungary</hi> against the Infidels, which may be one cause of the Desolations committed by Your Soldiers from <hi>Strasburg, Brisac,</hi> and <hi>Hunningen;</hi> for the <hi>Mahometan</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Cause are the same. What Affronts has the young Innocent <hi>Duke of Wirtemberg,</hi> not yet 12 years of Age, put upon <hi>Lewis le Grand?</hi> who has seiz'd his Place of Residence, driving the little <hi>Duke</hi> away to seek his Fortune; ravaging, destroying, and burning all his Dutchy of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> after

            <p>In what Sir, has the Ancient City of <hi>Spires</hi> offended you, that <hi>Justice</hi> is dethron'd from her Imperial Seat, and all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> of the Empire destroy'd, as tho Your Majesty intended to obliterate the very name of the <hi>Germans,</hi> as the <hi>Goths</hi> did that of the <hi>Romans?</hi> What sins has the Imperial City of <hi>Worms</hi> committed against Your <hi>Divinity?</hi> to be first plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and then burnt for company with her Neighbour <hi>Spires;</hi> all the poor Inhabitants, as well religious as secular, being commanded, upon pain of death, to retire into no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, but what was under the <hi>French</hi> domination. What a miserable Spectacle was it to behold the starving Gentry and Commonalty forced to march through ruin'd Countries, where they left their dead Children and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Woods and Ditches; and to render this Action more memorable and renowned in future Annals, Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty chose the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> the Festival of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> (of which <hi>Order</hi> Your Majesty is the <hi>Head</hi>) to make this great Sacrifice to Your Glory? the fiery Tongues ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appear'd to the <hi>Apostles</hi> upon this day, was an argument to Your Majesty to storm Heaven with the Cries and Flames of <hi>Imperial</hi> Cities, a new sort of <hi>Gigantomachia. Solyman,</hi> the great Persecutor of the Christians in the <hi>East,</hi> became Master of <hi>Constantinople</hi> upon the day of the Feast of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost; Louis</hi> the XIVth, the great Persecutor of the <hi>West,</hi> did famous Actions the same day, and seems resolv'd to make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day of the year a Fast in memory of his Tragical Exploits.</p>
            <p>We hear Your Majesty has commanded the <hi>Academy</hi> of Painters at <hi>Paris</hi> to draw the History of this War; they must not forget to represent your Engineers melting the Bells, Clocks, Church-Leads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to turn them into Instruments of War; their blowing up of Vaults and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96208:10"/>Arches; their knocking and pulling down all that surviv'd the Flames, lest there should be the least Retreat for the languishing Inhabitants: They have not spar'd the Bones and Ashes of the Dead, the stately Sepulchres and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Emperours and Empresses at <hi>Spires</hi> and <hi>Worms,</hi> being all buried in the Ruins, as those of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi> II. <hi>Henry</hi> II. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. <hi>Henry</hi> V. and their Empresses. <hi>Attila</hi> and his <hi>Goths</hi> left many Towers standing, which are now pull'd down by Your Majesty's strong and mighty Arm; <hi>quod non fecerunt Barbari, fecit Ludovicus Magnus, Justus, Pius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Injuries and Affronts put upon the Bishop of <hi>Worms,</hi> near Ninety years of Age, and a Prince of the Empire, are almost incredible, if they had not been perpetrated by <hi>French</hi>-men, who hurried the old Venerable Pastor up and down in a Chair, laid him in a ruin'd Castle, and menac'd him with blows, unless he would discover all the Plate and Riches of the Church.</p>
            <p>All your Declarations of War accuse the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Elector Palatine</hi> of secret Machinations against your Majesty, as stirring up of Wars against you, and exciting all the Princes and States of <hi>Christendom</hi> to rise up in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>France;</hi> whereas your Majesty design'd nothing by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning this barbarous War, but to maintain the Peace and Happiness of <hi>Christendom,</hi> for which your Majesty's desire is most sincere. Now how notoriously false these Accusations are against the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Elector Palatine, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body may easily judge, who knows the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the temper of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as well as the condition and state of the <hi>Prince Palatine,</hi> who has few or no <hi>Envoys</hi> running from Court to Court, no <hi>Spies,</hi> no <hi>masqueraded Incendiaries.</hi> Your Majesty sent to the Imperial Court Mr. <hi>Seppeville</hi> a little before the Truce, and after him <hi>Chiverny,</hi> who presently after was dispatch'd to the Northern Courts; <hi>Lusignan</hi> succeeded him, and like a common Herauld pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished

            <p>'Tis notorious to all the World, how your Majesty has

Ever since the last Truce, your Majesty hath Treated the faithful <hi>Spanish</hi> Subjects as common Enemies, Arresting their Persons, and Confiscating their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states; because the <hi>Soverain Council</hi> of <hi>Brabant</hi> durst be so honest, as to pronounce a favourable Sentence for the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> (now by the special Providence of Heaven, <hi>King of Great Britain</hi>) against the <hi>Count de Solre,</hi> betwixt whom there had been a great and long Suit depending, for several <hi>Seigneuries</hi> and Lands.</p>

How often have the Ministers and Envoys of <hi>Spain</hi> remonstrated against these Proceedings, and made use of the Mediations of the Kings of <hi>England, Charles</hi> the Second, and <hi>James</hi> the Second, the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of the Seven United <hi>Provinces,</hi> who were all <hi>Guarantees</hi> of the Peace and Truce; but your Majesty was resolv'd to declare a <hi>King</hi> your

            <p>After your taking of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> in the middle of a full Peace, your Majesty's Ministers declar'd up and down, That then the Foundation of a lasting Peace was laid, that City which had been the Source of many Quarrels, being now in their Master's possession. But the <hi>Germans,</hi> especially the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> saw their fatal Error too late; their Countries being thereby laid open and expos'd to the fury of the <hi>French,</hi> in whose way the Bulwark of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> had always laid as a <hi>Rampart</hi> of those <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Territories,</hi> which are now a lamentable heap of Ruines: But if we should enter far into the secret Conduct of this Affair, we shall find the principal Author of it in <hi>England,</hi> laid asleep in the poysonous Bosome of a <hi>French Dalila,</hi> which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted as much to the loss of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> as <hi>Helena</hi> did to that of <hi>Troy;</hi> this Fortress lies now like the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse, sending forth every day armed Men to burn and destroy all about the Frontiers of the Empire.

This, Sir, will raise and kindle some sparks and rays of former <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> in your Subjects breasts; your Majesty will be the looser, your People gainers; the Sun of your Glory shining with a false light, will suffer a total Eclipse, which must have a fatal influence upon your Glory and pretended Grandure. One little spark of Fire from abroad, may kindle such a Fire in <hi>France,</hi> that all your Engines will never be able to quench; the Necessities of your People hath rendred them extreamly sensible and susceptible of any impressions; the <hi>Commons</hi> are opprest in the highest degrees, the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> have no commerce, the <hi>Nobility</hi> is debased, the <hi>Clergy</hi> dis-respected, all in confusion; the greatest part of <hi>Europe</hi> is prepar'd to assist them, the rest are providing for the general Invasion of <hi>France</hi> on all sides, from all parts, both by Sea and Land, from <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> the <hi>South</hi> and the <hi>North;</hi> not to force your Majesties Subjects to Rebel, but only to throw off their intolerable Yoke of Slavery, their Fetters and their Chains; and to free themselves as well as their Posterity from all the Miseries of <hi>Bondage,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they groan, and pine away. Your Majesties <hi>Edicts</hi> must be recall'd, the old ones resetled upon a sure bottom; your Finances regulated, your heavy Taxes and Impositions moderated. These things, Sir, will be done, and remember that <hi>Truth</hi> told you so; the late easy <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> in <hi>England</hi> is so fresh and deep in your Memory, that I need not represent the History to your Majesty, least
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96208:16"/>it should make you Abdicate before your time, whereby your Throne will become vacant, till <hi>Truth</hi> is set upon it. The Late King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had neither burnt Cities, Towns, or Villages, he had not laid whole Countries in ashes, yet how sudden and quick was his overthrow, and ruine; not so much as one Battel, his Fleet and Army were cold in his defence, his strong holds yeilded themselves, his Subjects tho' train'd up in a course of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> did generally revolt and rise up against him, yet they had not felt half the Smart and Oppressions that the Subjects of <hi>France</hi> bear at present: The Late King <hi>James</hi> was but just entred into the Schools of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> he was many <hi>Classes</hi> below Your Majesty, being only in the bud, whereas your Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are come now to full Maturity, and must rot in few Months.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96208:18"/>of Mind, and remorses of Conscience seiz'd upon him, that he confin'd himself in his Castle of <hi>Plessis la Tour</hi> as in a Prison, apprehending all the World to be his Enemy; no body was admitted to see him, but his Domestick Servants, and them he chang'd every Week; 400 Archers kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant guard at the Gate, whilst others walked continually the rounds to prevent any surprize; he order'd Iron Gates, Spikes, and Crows feet, to be placed every where about the Castle; besides four great Iron Watch-houses full of holes, out of which his Guards might shoot at pleasure; he left no Man of whom he had the least suspition either in Town or Country, but he sent his Guards not only to bid them depart, but to conduct them away; during this confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himself he was always displacing the great Officers of his Kingdom, Civil and Military, which made some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was impaired in his Senses and Intellectuals, but they were mistaken and knew not his humours, says that wise Man, and great Historian, <hi>Philip de Comines</hi>'s Book VI. As to his jealousie, all Princes (if they are wise) are prone to it, especially if they have made many Enemies, and injur'd many People; <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. had some thoughts of easing his Country, but he should have begun sooner, saith the <hi>Historian;</hi> for he had given his Kingdom many Wounds, which bled fiercely, and requir'd a long time for their consolidation and cure. The last Years of his life, which he might have desired to pass in tranquillity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, serv'd only to perplex and torment him; Heaven refus'd to sweeten the sharpness of his troubles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude of mind, notwithstanding he had beg'd the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Hermit</hi> of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and the Prayers of the Church.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96208:18"/>thro the whole Stage of your Majesties <hi>Reign▪</hi> He had no Amity or Correspondence with the sworn Enemies of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi> (with whom you are in a stronger Alliance, than ever you were with any Christian Prince) but refus'd all Intelligence and Friendship with them, even to refuse Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Turkish Ambassador,</hi> who brought along with him a great <hi>Roll</hi> of <hi>Relicks,</hi> (which had remain'd at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>) together with a vast Sum of Money.</p>
            <p>'Tis now high time, that <hi>Truth</hi> should turn her head, and speak to the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> what will become of you, if things come to extremity; or if you do not take timely measures for the preservation of your selfs and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by a generous, tho' necessary <hi>Declaration:</hi> If the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> (who grow more and more powerful upon your Frontiers) break through the <hi>Pyrenean Barriers,</hi> you will soon see all <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Gascony</hi> in flames. If the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> and <hi>Milanois</hi> pass into <hi>Dauphine</hi> (as there is nothing to hinder them) then all <hi>Provence, Lionnois, &amp;c.</hi> will be laid in Ashes. If the <hi>Swisses</hi> break into <hi>Franche Comte,</hi> then all <hi>Burgundy</hi> must be set on Fire. If the <hi>Germans,</hi> and <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates</hi> get into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> or <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> then <hi>Champagn</hi> grows hot. If the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> into <hi>Picardy,</hi> then <hi>Normandy,</hi> the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Brie</hi> must burn for it. If the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Fleets disembark several Armies upon the Coasts, then <hi>Bretagne, Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Guienne</hi> must be destroy'd; so that there is a terrible Prospect before your eyes. Your own Armies paid with the sweat of your brows, must be the <hi>Firebrands</hi> of your Country, under pretence to save the Carcass of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> Reflect a little upon the lamentable State of <hi>France,</hi> and if you can bear it any longer, the World must think you Asses, Bousalo's, Camels, Beasts of Burthen, rather then Men endow'd with any Spirit or Reason, or Sense of the least Liberty. You have had your <hi>Conde</hi>'s, your <hi>Coligni</hi>'s,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96208:19"/>and your <hi>Guise</hi>'s, Men of Great Souls, and vast Enterprise <hi>Truth</hi> speaks, and offers here to head and conduct you; <hi>Nil desperandum me Duce, &amp; Auspice Christo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Great Sir,</hi> I do apply my self to your <hi>Throne</hi> once more; take from the Infallible mouth of <hi>Truth</hi> her last Prayer and Request, which ever she intends to make to you; <hi>viz.</hi> Remember that which your Pious Mother <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> hath often told you, when she us'd to shew your <hi>Majesty</hi> her Breast eaten to the very Ribs with a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous greedy <hi>Cancer,</hi> upon which she us'd to conjure your <hi>Majesty</hi> to be contented with what <hi>God</hi> Almighty had libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bestow'd upon you, fearing (by something she had early discover'd in your Complexion) least you should lose your own, in endeavouring to force away that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
